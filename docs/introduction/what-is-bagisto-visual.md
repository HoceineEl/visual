It provides a simple, flexible, and powerful system for creating, managing, and customizing themes for Bagisto stores, with a special focus on ease of use for both developers and merchants.

Whether you're a **merchant** who wants to tweak the look of your store or a **developer** looking to build custom themes, Bagisto Visual streamlines the process and eliminates the complexities traditionally associated with theme development.

## Why I Built Bagisto Visual

As a developer working on Bagisto for e-commerce stores, I encountered a significant challenge when tasked with creating a custom theme for a merchant. The process of building a theme from scratch was tedious and time-consuming. I had to dive deep into the Bagisto source code to figure out how themes worked, and there was no clear documentation on how to build a theme from the ground up.

Moreover, there was no standard approach or structure for building themes, which made it even harder to maintain or update the themes in the future. This posed a big problem for both developers and merchants. Whenever a merchant needed an update to their theme, they had to call the developer for help—leading to unnecessary delays, costs, and frustration.

This experience motivated me to create **Bagisto Visual**—a solution that simplifies the process of building and managing Bagisto themes. Bagisto Visual provides a standardized, intuitive framework that not only makes the theme creation process faster and easier but also empowers merchants to take control of their store’s design without relying on developers for every update.

By offering a **visual theme editor** and **JSON-based templates**, Bagisto Visual aims to fill the gaps in Bagisto’s theme system and create a seamless experience for everyone involved.
