# Interface Guide

The Visual Editor gives you full control over how your storefront looks — without writing any code. This page explains how to use the interface to add and arrange content visually.

## The Editor Layout

When you open the editor, you'll see three main areas:

### 1. Sidebar (left)

- Shows all the content on the page, broken into **sections**
- Sections are grouped as:
  - **Header & Footer**: Always visible on all pages
  - **Main Content**: Specific to the current page
- Click any section to open its settings

> 🖼️ _Screenshot suggestion:_ Highlight the sidebar, with arrows pointing to a header section, a dynamic section, and the “Add Section” button.

---

### 2. Preview Area (center)

- Shows exactly how your storefront looks
- Updates instantly as you make changes
- Click items in the preview to edit their settings in the sidebar

> 🖼️ _Screenshot suggestion:_ Show a preview with a section selected and the live editor reacting to a text change.

---

### 3. Toolbar (top)

- Shows which **page** you're editing (e.g. homepage, contact)
- Lets you **switch language** or **preview screen sizes**
- Some themes may also show draft / publish controls

> 🖼️ _Screenshot suggestion:_ Annotate the top bar with page selector and preview icons.

## What You Can Do

- **Add Sections**
  Click “Add Section” to choose from available content blocks (e.g., banner, products, newsletter).

- **Reorder Sections**
  Drag and drop sections in the sidebar to change their order on the page.

- **Edit Section Settings**
  Click a section to change text, images, colors, layout options, and more.

- **Remove Sections**
  Click the ••• menu on a section and choose “Remove” to delete it.

- **Edit Blocks Inside a Section**
  Some sections include blocks — small repeatable items like feature cards, product tiles, or categories.

## Tips for Merchants

- Changes you make are **saved automatically**
- You can preview how your store looks on **desktop, tablet, and mobile**
- Not all sections are removable — headers and footers are fixed in most themes
- Each page (home, product, contact) may have different available content
