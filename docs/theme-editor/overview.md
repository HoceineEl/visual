# Overview

The Visual Editor is where you build and customize your storefront in real time — without writing code. It lets you add sections, update content, and see changes live as you make them.

## What Can You Do?

- Add sections like banners, featured products, or newsletters
- Change images, text, buttons, colors, and layout options
- Reorder content by dragging and dropping sections
- Preview how your store looks on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Customize each page individually (like homepage, contact, etc.)

## Sections, Pages & Themes

- Your storefront is built using **sections**
- Each page (homepage, contact, etc.) can have different sections
- Some sections (like header or footer) appear on every page
- You can preview and switch between different pages right from the editor

> 🖼️ _Screenshot suggestion:_ Highlight the page switcher at the top and different sections like “Header” and “Main Content.”

## Why Use the Visual Editor?

- **No code required** — edit everything visually
- **Live preview** — see changes as you make them
- **Flexible layout** — reorder or remove sections anytime
- **Built for merchants** — fast, simple, and clear
